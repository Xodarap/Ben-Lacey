    We Rate Dogs is an extremely popular twitter account that purports to rate dogs, but actually gives all of them a score >10/10. In an attempt to make this more rigorous, I used a neural network to evaluate the picture of the dog in the tweet, then created a twitter bot to automatically respond with the dog's actual rating.
